A poorly designed one? It’s a source of endless frustration, bugs, and wasted developer hours. Here are the most common API design mistakes I’ve encountered—and how to avoid them.\nMistake 1: Inconsistent Naming Conventions\nNothing frustrates developers more than an API that can’t decide on a naming convention.\nThe fix: Pick a convention and stick to it religiously.\nUse:\nPlural nouns for resources (/users, not /user)\nKebab-case for multi-word resources (/user-profiles)\nHTTP verbs for actions, not URL verbs\nMistake 2: Ignoring HTTP Status Codes\nReturning 200 OK for everything, including errors, is a cardinal sin.\nUse status codes semantically:\n2xx - Success\n4xx - Client errors (bad request, unauthorized, not found)\n5xx - Server errors\nMistake 3: Poor Error Messages\nGeneric error messages waste everyone’s time.\nGood error messages include:\nA machine-readable error code\nA human-readable message\nDetails about what went wrong\nHints about how to fix it\nMistake 4: Not Versioning Your API\nAPIs evolve. Breaking changes without versioning break your consumers’ applications.\nStart with v1 from day one. It costs nothing and saves future pain.\nMistake 5: Returning Too Much (or Too Little) Data\nOver-fetching wastes bandwidth; under-fetching forces multiple requests.\nConsider:\nField selection for customizing responses\nPagination for collections\nExpansion for related resources (?expand=orders)\nMistake 6: Ignoring Pagination\nReturning 10,000 records in one response is never okay.\nPagination strategies:\nOffset-based - Simple but can skip items if data changes\nCursor-based - More reliable for real-time data\nKeyset - Best for large datasets\nMistake 7: No Rate Limiting\nWithout rate limiting, one misbehaving client can bring down your entire API.\nRate limiting protects:\nYour infrastructure from abuse\nFair usage across all clients\nYour API from accidental infinite loops\nBonus: Document Everything\nThe best-designed API is useless if no one knows how to use it.\nUse OpenAPI/Swagger to:\nGenerate interactive documentation\nEnable client SDK generation\nValidate requests and responses\nKeep docs in sync with code\nConclusion\nGreat API design is about empathy for the developers who will use your API. Every decision should make their lives easier, not harder.\nRemember:\nConsistency is king\nErrors are features, not afterthoughts\nPlan for change from the start\nWhen in doubt, follow REST conventions\nYour API is a product. Treat it like one.\nWhat API design patterns have you found most valuable? What mistakes would you add to this list?","description":"Real-world API anti-patterns that cause developer pain — inconsistent naming, swallowed errors, missing pagination, and no versioning. A guide to terrible API design.","id":"https://hownotto.dev/blog/api-design-mistakes/","path":"/blog/api-design-mistakes/","title":"7 API Design Anti-Patterns That Will Ruin Your Architecture"},"https://hownotto.dev/blog/clean-code-principles/":{"body":"Writing clean code isn’t just about making your code work—it’s about making it understandable, maintainable, and a joy to work with. Here are the essential principles every developer should internalize.\nWhy Clean Code Matters\nClean code is the foundation of sustainable software development. When code is clean, it’s:\nEasier to understand - New team members can onboard faster\nEasier to modify - Changes require less effort and introduce fewer bugs\nEasier to test - Well-structured code is naturally more testable\nLess costly - Technical debt accumulates slower\nThe Core Principles\n1. Meaningful Names\nNames should reveal intent. A variable name should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it’s used.\nChoose names that are:\nPronounceable - You should be able to discuss them in conversation\nSearchable - Single-letter names are hard to find\nConsistent - Use the same concept throughout the codebase\n2. Functions Should Do One Thing\nThe Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that a function should have one, and only one, reason to change.\n3. Keep Functions Small\nFunctions should be small. How small? Smaller than that.\nA good rule of thumb:\n20 lines or less is a good target\nOne level of abstraction per function\nOne level of indentation where possible\n4. Avoid Side Effects\nPure functions are easier to test and reason about. They take inputs and return outputs without modifying external state.\n5. Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)\nDuplication is the root of all evil in software. Every piece of knowledge should have a single, unambiguous representation.\nHowever, be careful not to DRY prematurely—wait until you see the pattern three times before abstracting.\n6. Comments Are a Last Resort\nGood code is self-documenting. Comments should explain why, not what.\nValid reasons for comments:\nLegal requirements\nExplaining intent behind non-obvious decisions\nWarnings about consequences\nTODO notes (but address them!)\nPractical Tips for Writing Cleaner Code\nWrite tests first - TDD naturally leads to cleaner, more modular code\nRefactor continuously - Clean up as you go, not in big batches\nRead more code - Study well-written open source projects\nCode review - Fresh eyes catch issues you’ve become blind to\nTake breaks - Tired developers write messy code\nThe Boy Scout Rule\n“Leave the campground cleaner than you found it.”\nEvery time you touch code, leave it a little better than you found it. Small improvements compound over time.\nConclusion\nClean code is not about perfection—it’s about professionalism. It’s about caring enough to do your job well and respecting your future self and teammates who will maintain this code.\nStart applying these principles today, one small improvement at a time. Your future self will thank you.\nWhat clean code principles have had the biggest impact on your work?

But with great power comes great responsibility—poorly configured containers can lead to security vulnerabilities, bloated images, and production headaches. Here’s how to do Docker right.\nUse Multi-Stage Builds\nMulti-stage builds are the single most impactful optimization for your Docker images.\nBenefits:\nSmaller images (10x reduction is common)\nNo build tools or dev dependencies in production\nFaster deployments and lower storage costs\nUse Specific Base Image Tags\nNever use latest—it’s a recipe for non-reproducible builds.\nMinimize Layers and Leverage Caching\nOrder your Dockerfile instructions from least to most frequently changing.\nRun as Non-Root User\nRunning as root inside containers is a security risk.\nUse .dockerignore\nJust like .gitignore, a .dockerignore keeps unnecessary files out of your image.\nThis:\nReduces build context size\nSpeeds up builds\nPrevents secrets from being copied\nHealth Checks\nLet Docker know when your application is actually ready.\nHealth checks enable:\nAutomatic container restarts on failure\nLoad balancer integration\nProper rolling deployments\nSecurity Best Practices\nScan for Vulnerabilities\nDon’t Store Secrets in Images\nUse Read-Only File System\nOptimize for Production\nUse Alpine-Based Images\nCopy Only What’s Needed\nSet Resource Limits\nLogging Best Practices\nWrite logs to stdout/stderr, not files.\nLet the container runtime handle log aggregation.\nExample Production Dockerfile\nHere’s a complete example putting it all together:\nConclusion\nProduction-ready Docker images require attention to:\nSize - Multi-stage builds, Alpine base images\nSecurity - Non-root users, vulnerability scanning\nReliability - Health checks, resource limits\nReproducibility - Pinned versions, .dockerignore\nTake the time to optimize your Dockerfiles—your future deployments will thank you.\nWhat Docker practices have made the biggest difference in your production deployments?","description":"The worst Docker mistakes in production — bloated images, running as root, no health checks, secrets baked into layers.

It feels natural — it’s short, it’s everywhere, and it “just works.” Until it doesn’t.\nThe Problem: int Has No Fixed Size\nThe C standard guarantees only that int is at least 16 bits. That’s it. The actual size depends on the compiler and target architecture:\nPlatformsizeof(int)\nArduino (AVR)2 bytes (16-bit)\nx86 Linux/Windows4 bytes (32-bit)\nMost 64-bit systems4 bytes (32-bit)\nSome embedded systems2 bytes (16-bit)\nThis means code that “works” on your machine can silently break when compiled elsewhere.\nReal-World Disasters\nThe $370 Million Explosion: Ariane 5 Flight 501\nOn June 4, 1996, the European Space Agency launched the Ariane 5 rocket on its maiden flight. Thirty-seven seconds after liftoff, the rocket veered off course and self-destructed. Total loss: $370 million in hardware and four scientific satellites.\nThe cause? A 64-bit floating-point number was converted to a 16-bit signed integer. The value was larger than 32,767 (the maximum for a signed 16-bit int), causing an overflow. The navigation system interpreted the garbage value as a legitimate flight correction, sending the rocket tumbling.\nThe tragic irony: this code was reused from Ariane 4, where the values never exceeded 16-bit range. Nobody verified the assumptions still held for the faster Ariane 5.\nThe official investigation report concluded: “The internal SRI software exception was caused during execution of a data conversion from 64-bit floating point to 16-bit signed integer value.”\nThis is the most expensive integer overflow bug in history — and a permanent reminder of why fixed-width types with explicit range checking matter.\nSilent Overflow\nNo warning. No error. Just wrong data.\nSecurity Vulnerabilities\nInteger overflow is a classic attack vector. When int size is unpredictable, so is overflow behavior:\nThe 2014 Heartbleed vulnerability was partly caused by integer size assumptions. Countless CVEs trace back to int overflow on unexpected platforms.\nCross-Platform Data Corruption\nSerializing an int and deserializing on another platform:\nBinary protocols, file formats, network packets — all break silently.\nThe Fix: Fixed-Width Integer Types\nC99 introduced &lt;stdint.h&gt; with types that guarantee their size:\nWhy Fixed-Width Types Are Better\nPortable — Same size on every platform\nSelf-documenting — int32_t tells you exactly what to expect\nPredictable overflow — You know when it will happen\nBinary compatibility — Safe for serialization and protocols\nSecurity — Easier to audit for overflow vulnerabilities\nWhen int Is Still Acceptable\nThere are a few narrow cases:\nLoop counters for small, bounded iterations: for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)\nReturn values for success/failure (0/-1 convention)\nInterfacing with legacy APIs that expect int\nEven then, consider whether size_t (for array indexing) or a fixed-width type would be clearer.\nThe Anti-Pattern in Action\nHere’s typical bad code:\nFixed version:\nWhat About Performance?\nA common excuse: “But int is the native word size, so it’s faster!”\nThis was true decades ago. Modern compilers optimize fixed-width types just as well. Profile if you’re skeptical — you won’t find a difference in real workloads.\nThe tiny theoretical performance gain (if any) isn’t worth the portability and security risks.\nConclusion\nUsing int for anything beyond trivial local variables is a portability anti-pattern. The size is undefined, the behavior is unpredictable across platforms, and the security implications are severe.\nUse &lt;stdint.h&gt; fixed-width types:\nint32_t / uint32_t for general 32-bit integers\nint64_t / uint64_t for large values or timestamps\nint16_t / uint16_t for memory-constrained environments\nint8_t / uint8_t for byte manipulation\nYour future self — and everyone who ports your code — will thank you.\nWhat C anti-patterns have bitten you in production?
